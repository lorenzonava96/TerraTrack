** 🛰️ TerraTrack** is an open-source, cloud-based workflow for detecting and monitoring slow-moving landslides using Sentinel-2 imagery and optical feature tracking (FT).

It is fully reproducible via Google Colab and supports scalable motion analysis using multiple tracking methods, terrain filtering, and time series reconstruction.

## Features

- Automated Sentinel-2 image acquisition via Earth Engine API
- Multiple feature tracking methods:
  - FFT-based Normalized Cross-Correlation (**FFT-NCC**)
  - Phase Cross-Correlation (**PCC**)
  - Median Dense Optical Flow (Farneback)
- Custom filtering pipeline:
  - Magnitude, angular coherence, PKR/SNR thresholds
  - Slope/aspect-based filtering, clustering
- Time series reconstruction using weighted or midpoint binning
- Export-ready, georeferenced median velocity maps and displacement time series, compatible with InSAR Explorer in QGIS.
