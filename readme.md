🛰️ **TerraTrack** is an open-source, cloud-based workflow for detecting and monitoring slow-moving landslides using Sentinel-2 imagery and optical feature tracking.

It is fully reproducible via Google Colab and supports scalable motion analysis using multiple tracking methods, terrain filtering, and time series reconstruction.

## 📒 Get Started

### ▶️ Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

Click the badge below to launch:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lorenzonava96/TerraTrack/blob/main/notebooks/TerraTrack_v1.ipynb)

---

### 🖥️ Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lorenzonava96/TerraTrack.git
cd TerraTrack

# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name terratrack_env python=3.10
conda activate terratrack_env

# Install required dependencies

# Move the notebook to the root directory so it can access the src/ folder
mv notebooks/TerraTrack_v1_local.ipynb

```
Launch the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or another compatible environment

</p>

- Automated Sentinel-2 image acquisition via Earth Engine API
- Multiple feature tracking methods:
  - FFT-based Normalized Cross-Correlation (**FFT-NCC**)
  - Phase Cross-Correlation (**PCC**)
  - Median Dense Optical Flow (Farneback)
- Custom filtering pipeline:
  - Magnitude, angular coherence, PKR/SNR thresholds
  - Slope/aspect-based filtering, clustering
- Time series reconstruction using weighted or midpoint binning
- Export-ready, georeferenced median velocity maps and displacement time series, compatible with InSAR Explorer in QGIS.
